# Evaluating-Sales-Promotions-Effectiveness-

The objective of this research is to assess the effects of various sales promotional tools and analyze the impact of retailers’ and manufacturers’ gross profits for each promotional tool on four brands of liquid laundry detergent.  We identified three different best-fit models based on the nature of the dependent variable: A binary logit model for purchase incidence, a semi-log regression model for purchase quantity, and a multinomial model for individual decision makers’ choice behavior. We found that to optimize the expected purchase quantity of each brand, in-store display advertising is the most effective promotional tool. However, the overarching goal of retailers and manufacturers might be profit maximization. In such a case, retailers can adopt a 70% pass-through and implement a display advertising campaign for Tide only, pulling the category’s total gross profit by 111.1% to $1312.5. Meanwhile, a 100% pass-through works better for manufacturers along with display advertising campaigns to increase gross profit for each brand.
